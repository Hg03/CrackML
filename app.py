    mdlit('> A Machine Learning algorithm is an application that can learn from the data without relying on the explicit instructions to follow. On the contrary, a traditional algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed especially by a computer, which does not learn anything on its own. For instance, let us say that you want to compute the sum of 2 numbers. A traditional algorithm would implement a sum function which is explicitly programmed to take the input numbers and return their sum. However, a Machine Learning algorithm would take as input the sample (training) dataset with the numbers and their corresponding sum and would learn the pattern automatically such that given a new pair of numbers (test data), it would return their sum itself without being explicitly programmed to do so.<br><br> Lets Train a sckit learn based linear model that returns the sum of two number - <br><br>')
