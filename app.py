On the contrary, a traditional algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed especially by a computer, which does not learn anything on its own. For instance, let us say that you want to compute the sum of 2 numbers. A traditional algorithm would implement a sum function which is explicitly programmed to take the input numbers and return their sum. However, a Machine Learning algorithm would take as input the sample (training) dataset with the numbers and their corresponding sum and would learn the pattern automatically such that given a new pair of numbers (test data), it would return their sum itself without being explicitly programmed to do so.<br><br> Lets Train a sckit learn based linear model that returns the sum of two number - <br><br>')

Deep Learning algorithms need a large amount of data to understand it perfectly, which is why they do not perform well when given a small dataset. <br> **B.** Deep Learning algorithms try to learn thehigh-level features (important and relevant characteristics of the dataset) on their own, as opposed to the traditional Machine Learning algorithms, which require a manual input of the feature set.<br> **C.**Deep Learning algorithms rely heavily on GPU and generally need high-end machines to train. This is because they perform a large number of multiplications and other operations which could be highly parallelized in GPUs. A Deep Neural Network consists of many hidden layers with hundreds of neurons in each layer and each layer performs the same computation. Using a high-end machine and/or GPU would drastically speed up the overall processing by executing each layerâ€™s computation in parallel.''')
